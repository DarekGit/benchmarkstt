       so  first to face our audience  
       please welcome the leader of the conservative party  
       the prime minister  theresa may  
       applause 
       thank you  
       thank you very much  thank you  
       good evening  prime minister  
       your first question comes from abigail eatock  please  
       why should the public trust anything you say or any of your policies 
       when you have a known track record of broken promises 
       and backtracking during your time 
       as home secretary and now prime minister? 
       well  thank you  david  and thank you    
       applause 
       thank you  abigail  
       and can i first of all say good evening to everybody  
       and thank you for coming to be an audience at this programme tonight  
       which is an important part of the election campaign  
       let me tell you about some of the things 
       that i did as home secretary  abigail  
       i said that i would ensure 
       that we were dealing with extremist hate preachers  
       and i excluded more than any home secretary before me  
       i said i would do something about stop and search  
       cos i don't think anybody should be stopped and searched 
       on the streets of our country because of the colour of their skin  
       i said i would be tough on crime  
       and i said i would ensure our police and our security services 
       had the powers they need to be able to do their job  
       and i gave them those in the legislation that i put through  
       and i made sure that we kept the records of criminals and terrorists 
       on the dna database  
       whereas diane abbott actually wants to wipe them clean  
       and i don't think that's a good idea  
       cos that helps us catch criminals  
       so  no backtracking  and    
       applause 
         no broken promises? what were you thinking of  abigail? 
       erm    well  you have backtracked as prime minister  
       you backtracked when you became leader of the conservatives  
       and then immediately prime minister after the referendum  
       you said you wouldn't call an election  and you did  
       and then you are here calling an election 
       and refusing to take part in debates  
       refusing to answer people's questions  
       refusing to talk to jeremy corbyn  
       and you've backtracked on your social care policy  
       and your entire manifesto has holes in it  
       and everyone else can see that  
       well  first of all    
       applause 
       first of all  can i just say  
       i'm not refusing to take part in debates  
       because i'm here answering questions from you  
       this audience  this evening  
       and that's what i think is important in an election campaign  
       it's not politicians arguing amongst each other  
       but actually listening and taking questions from voters  
       and you mentioned about not holding    
       saying i wouldn't hold an election and now holding one  
       you're right   i thought we needed a period of stability  
       but what became clear to me when we went through the article 50 process 
       to trigger the process of leaving the european union  
       to respect the will of the british people  
       was that other parties wanted to frustrate those negotiations  
       and wanted to frustrate that will of the people 
       that had been expressed in the referendum vote  
       and  you know  it would have been easy   i could have said  
       "ok  i'm prime minister  there's another couple of years going   
       "why don't i just stay and hang on in the job?" 
       but i didn't do that  i've called an election because of brexit  
       i was willing to do that 
       because i think this is a really important moment for our country  
       we've got to get this right  
       if we get it right  i'm optimistic for the british people  
       because i believe in the british people  but we need to get it right  
       applause 
       yes  the woman there  
       who is it that contested you  because labour have clearly 
       issued a whip to get people to vote for article 50 being passed  
       besides the lib dems  
       who have kind of said that they would like another referendum  
       i don't understand who it is 
       that has contested your leadership through brexit  
       well  you're right  we got the article 50 legislation 
       through parliament  
       that was important   it's triggered the ability for us 
       to start these negotiations  and those negotiations  by the way  
       start just 11 days after election day next week  
       so whoever comes in as prime minister  
       whoever comes in as a government  
       has got to be ready to actually get the ball rolling 
       and start those negotiations straight away  
       but it was clear through the discussions that we had 
       around that time that the other parties did want to frustrate us  
       and you say    you talk about the liberal democrats  
       i mean  we have a situation at the moment where if jeremy corbyn 
       was to get into number '  he'd be being propped up 
       by the liberal democrats and the scottish nationalists  
       you'd have diane abbott  who can't add up  
       sitting around the cabinet table  john mcdonnell  who's a marxist  
       nicola sturgeon  who wants to break our country up  
       and tim farron  who wants to take us back into the eu  
       the direct opposite of what the british people want  
       applause 
        you  sir   thank you  
       that being said  prime minister  
       one of the things that i would like to know is  
       secretly  do you really regret calling this election  
       now the polls have moved against you? 
       i'm a tory and i pray and hope that we win  or that you win  
       but you must feel a little bit of    "ooh!" a little bit of remorse  no? 
       no  i've been in politics quite a long time  and i've always said 
       at every election  the only poll that matters 
       is the one that takes place on polling day   yeah   
       and i think the british people  when they're voting  
       when everybody's casting your vote  people here and people watching 
       and others  have a simple choice  and it is about who do you trust 
       to have that leadership  to take us to get the best deal for brexit 
       in europe  and who's got the will and the vision  
       not just to take us through brexit  not just to get on with the job 
       of delivering brexit  but to take us beyond and build a better future 
       for this country  
       were you surprised  though  that the polls have gone from a lead of 20% 
       when you called the election  remorselessly down like that? 
       david  i'm never surprised at things that happen 
        during election campaigns   you thought you were that popular  
        and now you accept you're that popular?  no  
       i'm never surprised at things that happen during election campaigns  
       because the only poll i look at 
        is the one that takes place on election day   al right  you  sir  
       just face it   you called the election 
       for your own political gains  
       it's nothing to do with the good of the country   
       it's for your own political gains  
       no  it's not  sir  can i just say to you  as i've just said    
       applause 
       it would have been the easiest thing in the world for me  
       having become prime minister after the referendum 
       when david cameron resigned  to say  you know  the next election's 
       not till 2020  this is a good job  i enjoy the job  i want to do it   
       in this job i do what i believe is the best for britain  
       i could have stayed on doing that job for another couple of years    
       your party called a european referendum    
       i had the balls to call an election  
         for the good of the conservative party  
       you've called a general election for the good of conservative party  
        and it's going to backfire on you    no  i called     
       applause 
       i called a general election because i believe that the british people 
       have a right to vote  and to say who they want to see leading them 
       through the brexit negotiations  
       and i believe they should have a prime minister 
       who has an absolutely resolute determination to respect their will  
       my party is the only party that is going to respect the will 
       of the british people  get on with the job  
        and deliver a successful brexit   ok  
       applause 
       we'll come on to brexit in a moment  one more point from you  
       i think it's a very different thing to debate a studio audience 
       as debating the other leaders  and i think there has been a lot 
       of debating through the media  
       would it not give a more interesting debate 
       having you say these things face to face to the other leaders  
       and speak that way about the policies  
       rather than through tv and through journalists? 
        applause  well    
       i think election campaigns should be about getting out and about  
       yes  answering questions from voters  meeting voters  
       talking to people across the uk in a whole variety of circumstances  
       and i'm afraid i think that actually having that interaction 
       with voters is more useful for the voter and for the politician  
       i think anybody who wants to be prime minister 
       should be out and about listening to what people are thinking  
       and i don't think seven politicians just arguing amongst themselves 
       is actually that interesting or that revealing  
       ok  let's    applause 
       we'll go on  i want to go on  cos we've talked about the election  
       let's go on to talking about brexit  
       which you've mentioned once or twice  
       barry clarke  could we have your question  please? 
        good evening   good evening  
       if the eu start being awkward  
       why don't we just cut and run and pay no money at all? 
        well     applause 
       i've said that i think no deal would be better than a bad deal  
       now  i'm confident we can get a good deal 
       with the right plan for those negotiations  
       because i think a good deal is in our interest  
       and in the interests of the rest of the eu  
       but we have to be prepared to stand up for britain  
       we have to be prepared to go in there 
       recognising that we're not willing to accept a bad deal  
       what is a bad deal? people are very confused  
       you talk all the time about a bad deal  which you won't accept  
       can you explain what in your mind would be a bad deal? 
       well  yes  i think on the one hand  david  
       you've got politicians in europe  some of whom are talking 
       about punishing the uk for leaving the eu  
       i think what they want to see in terms of that punishment 
       would be a bad deal  and secondly  you've got politicians here 
       in the united kingdom  who seem to be willing to accept any deal  
       whatever it is  just for the sake of getting a deal  
       i think the danger is  they'd be accepting 
       the worst possible deal at the highest possible price  
       applause 
       you  sir  at the back there  
       good evening  
       you always say you want to serve for the whole people in britain  
       but brexit was basically voted by 52%  
       so  how do you actually serve for the whole country 
       if just 52% backed brexit? 
       well  the first thing i would say is that as i go around 
       and talk to people  individuals  business representatives and others  
       i find that actually  the greater majority of opinion here in the uk 
       is that the decision was taken  the public were given their choice   
       they chose to leave the european union  
       let's just have a government that gets on with it  
       and delivers a good deal  
       and how i would respond  for all of those who voted to remain  
       and i voted to remain  is to say that now we must make sure 
       we get the negotiations right  we get that good free trade agreement  
       the continued co operation  a deep and special partnership with the eu  
       but that also  we take this opportunity of brexit  
       new trade deals around the rest of the world  
       actually seeing how we can build a more prosperous  
       stronger and fairer britain  
       i think we can do that  
       and i think we can do that because i believe in britain 
       and i believe in the british people  
       what i'm    applause 
       it's curious  because just over a year ago  
       when you were a remainer  er    
       and david cameron got this wrong  and he resigned  
       you got it wrong and remained to become prime minister  
       you said  
       "remaining inside the european union makes us more prosperous " 
       yesterday  you said  "brexit makes us more prosperous " 
       laughter i mean  what    
       where are you at on this? 
       what i    and i set out very carefully before the referendum 
       why i believed on balance we should stay in the eu  
       i also said the sky will not fall in if we leave the eu  
       what then happened was the british people  
       who had been given the choice   
       you know  parliament decided to say to the public  "it's your choice " 
        they chose that we should leave the eu   but will we be less prosperous? 
        going back to your old argument   we've got to make sure 
       that we can actually use the opportunities that come from brexit  
       we've got to grasp those opportunities  
       but fundamentally  david  the thing i think that matters most in this 
       is being willing to deliver on the will of the people  
       not saying  "oh  you got it wrong  let's have a second referendum " 
       but saying  "you voted  you've chosen  you want a government 
       "that's going to do it for you " and i say to people  
       if you voted for brexit  you need to make sure you get it 
       with a government  with me and my team  
       who will actually deliver it for you  
       yeah  but the people made the wrong choice  by your book  
        cos you were a remainer   no  the people    
       they made the wrong choice because you were a remainer  
       so  in your mind you must have thought  "what are they on about?" 
       and then you said they'll get richer if they stay  
       if they leave  they won't   they'll be poorer  
       can you now honestly say there's no difference   
       we'll get richer by leaving just the same as we would have done 
       if we'd remained? 
        i said     or is there going to be a price to pay? 
       i did say at the time that i thought there were advantages  on balance  
       in being in the eu  but now  what i believe we must do 
       is deliver on the will of the people  
       but also make sure we make a success of it  
       so what i'm doing as prime minister 
       is saying  let's find those opportunities 
       that will enable us to be more prosperous in the future  
       all right  too much of me  the man over there  you  sir  
       no  on the far side there  yes  
        good evening   evening  
       you don't need to say good evening all the time  
       because i think we've met! laughter 
       it looks increasingly likely that we are going to have to pay 
       a divorce bill  and it's speculated anything between nothing 
       to 100 billion  
       could you quantify in billions of pounds  straightforward question  
       what is a good deal? 
       well  the    
       i'm not going to give you a figure on that for two reasons  
       first of all because we need to go through very carefully  
       as part of the negotiation  what rights and obligations 
       the united kingdom has  
       and secondly  because if i gave you a figure here tonight  
       for what i thought would be a good figure  
       that wouldn't be a very good negotiating stance when i'm sitting 
       down  if i'm prime minister in 11 days' time  with the european union  
       but it is    it's his money you're spending? 
       yes  well  it's all our money that will be    
       that is taxpayers' money  david  
       but you don't go into a negotiating stance saying  "the thing i 
       "want out of this is  absolutely want out of this  is x " 
       because you can bet your bottom dollar 
       the other side is going to try and make sure you don't get x  
       and do you think they'll have to   you'll have to agree that 
       before they'll talk about all the other things  trade 
       and all the rest of it? which way do you think it's going to run? 
       they've    i've been very clear  as indeed has the eu on recognising 
       that we need to negotiate that new relationship with them  
       which will be about trade  but will be about other things  too  
       so like co operation on security and criminal justice  
       they want to start off by talking about the bill  
       i want one of the early discussions to be about the reciprocal 
       arrangement for eu and uk citizens  
       they haven't said that we can't negotiate the trade deal 
       until we've agreed the bill  
       what they've said is we need to make sufficient progress  
       and what several of them have also said 
       is we need to get on to the trade deal quickly  
        the woman at the very back there    hello   hello  
       you've said that you think you can negotiate a good deal  but do you 
       really think that you actually have any real leverage with brussels? 
       well  yes  i do  and one of the reasons 
       i think we can negotiate a good deal is because  actually  
       a good deal  in trade terms  
       is not just of benefit to the uk  it's of benefit to businesses 
       in the remaining countries  remaining in the european union  
       so this isn't just about us  
       it's actually about a relationship that matters to them as well 
       as it matters to us  
       you over here  on the right  
       i'd like to pull you up on the comment about diane abbott's 
       miscalculations that you made a few minutes ago  
       cos philip hammond  who's chancellor of the exchequer 
       got a &#163;20 billion miscalculation a few weeks ago  
       so i think that's a bit rude of you  
       applause 
       well  what i will say is this  as i said earlier on  
       diane abbott wants to be home secretary and she wants to 
       wipe the records of criminals and terrorists from the dna database  
       that would mean we could catch fewer criminals and fewer terrorists  
       ok  you  sir  here  the man in green  
       talking about brexit and remainers  i think the voting 52% to 48%  
       i think you lack the confidence in asking the public  the electorate  
       one more time because the voting was so in the middle  
       what would the electorate want to do? 
       i think nigel farage made a big mess  
       i think michael gove led the electorate the wrong way 
       and boris johnson  they had buses  
       you know  pasted with "nhs  &#163;350 million"  
       we were all told lies  
       so even people who voted out  
       perhaps they should be given the second chance  
       so you should have the confidence to say  "shall we have another vote?" 
       over    over    
       groaning 
       look  can i put it like this? 
       over the years  in the european union  
       and its european economic community  there've been a number 
       of occasions where referendums have been held in countries  
       there was one in ireland  i think france is an example as well  
       where they voted against what the eu was suggesting  
       and basically  the bureaucrats and the eu politicians 
       turned round to those countries and said  
       "you've got it wrong  have another vote  
       "we want you to come up with what we think is the right answer " 
       now we know how much it's going to cost  
       sorry  you can come back in a minute  
       at that time  i think  collectively  people here in the uk said  
       "you know what? that's not the way to behave  
       "if the people have given their choice  
       "let's listen to the people and deliver it on it for them " 
       on the wrong information  
       applause 
        you  sir   the wrong information  
       they weren't giving the right information to choose from  
       ok  you  sir  
       earlier this week  prime minister  you said that you wanted the people 
       of britain to trust you with regards to brexit and winning the election  
       how can the people trust you when your manifesto has not 
       given them any detail as to figures or what you propose to do 
       with other things in government? 
       well  what my manifesto    
       applause 
       you're right  i use that word "trust" 
       and i used it because that is actually what politicians  
       when we go out  when we ask people to vote for us  we are asking people 
       to trust us in the role that we are being  want to be voted in to  
       and i    if i look at our manifesto  
       what our manifesto has done is to be open with people 
       about the great challenges that we believe that this country faces 
       and that need to be addressed by whoever is in government  
       we've been open about that  
       i've also been open that there will be some hard choices 
       to be made in addressing those various challenges  
       you talk about figures in our manifesto  
       of course  we already have budgets that have been set out in 
       the autumn statement  as government  and in the spring budget  
       and we've added some figures in various areas like our extra funding 
       on the nhs and schools in the manifesto  
       but i think it's important that the next government sets out for 
       people the really big issues that are going to have to be addressed 
       by whoever is in government  and those are in our manifesto  
       the one thing that was missing from your manifesto and seemed to cause 
       a panic in the conservative party was the figures on what happens 
       to people who have to fund their care in old age 
       and we have a question about it from derek griffin  
       let's just have that  mr griffin  
       i'm just wondering  with regards to social care  
       you kind of spend your whole life obviously working hard 
       to build up a nest egg and have a nice  little pension and savings 
       so you can be comfortable in your later life after you've retired  
       but if it's all going to be taken away from you again  
       if care is needed  essentially  
       why should you even bother in the first place? 
       and a reminder that your manifesto said 
       &#163;100 000 is all you would be left with  
       well  the figure that you're left with at the moment is &#163;23 000  
       so we're actually quadrupling that  
       you are sticking with &#163;100 000? 
       yes!  i thought you'd changed that?  no  
       sorry  i thought you were going to have an upper limit? 
       the &#163;100 000 is a floor  david  there's a cap and a floor  
       ah  but you didn't mention the cap in the manifesto  
       no  but you didn't mention it in the manifesto  that's the point  
        i will come on to that   he's talking about the figures not being there  
       i will answer the question i was asked  if i may  
       do it your own way  applause 
       if we look at the situation at the moment  if you need care 
       then if you've got more than &#163;23 000 in savings  
       you have to pay for that care  
       and if you need residential care  
       the value of your house will be taken into account  
       and so it's today that we see people sometimes having to sell 
       their house in order to pay those bills  
       now  what we say is that  under the system we introduce  
       which is important because we need a sustainable system for the future  
       given the ageing population  
       if we do nothing  our social care system will collapse  
       we say we will ensure that people are able to protect more of 
       their savings  the &#163;100 000  
       that they will also not have to sell their house 
       during their lifetime to pay for their care bills  
       but i also wanted a system that was fair across the generations 
       and i believe this is  too  
       we said in our manifesto we'd consult on the details  
       i heard the scaremongering that came out after our manifesto 
       was published and i set out one of the details that  
       aspects that would have been in the consultation  which is about 
       having a cap on the absolute level  
       so there's a floor of &#163;100 000  
       you can protect &#163;100 000 and we'll consult on what should be the 
       cap of the   absolute cap   on the level of care costs  
       funny thing to leave out the cap  
       cos it's rather important for people  
       &#163;100 000 that you keep  but whether you get rid of half 
       a million or &#163;250 000 or that  the manifesto told you nothing  
       then you suddenly said  "oh  there will be a cap  
       "we won't charge you more than a certain amount " 
       odd to leave that out  wasn't it?" 
       no  we set out the principles in our manifesto  
       which are the ones i've just set out in the answer  
       which is crucially that it's fair across the generations  
       that we enable people to have the knowledge and the comfort of 
       knowing they won't have to sell their house in their lifetime 
        to pay for their care bills   barry wants to come back on it  
       obviously  from a personal perspective  
       you're saying about the caps  
       myself and my wife  for instance  we are actually both disabled  
       so  statistically  as we get older  
       we are maybe more likely to be the ones needing to use that care  
       so are there any kinds of safeguards or guarantees or something that 
       we're not going to be left bankrupt in our retirement  basically  
       purely because of a condition we have no control over? 
       yes  well  what i want to    
       applause 
       what i want to do  in relation to the details of 
       the policy  how it actually works  including the level of the cap  
       is to consult  consult with people  consult with voters  
       also consult with organisations  charities and others working 
       with older people  so that we ensure that we get that right  
       and i think that's a fair way to do it 
       rather than just producing a figure now  
       i think it's important to have that consultation  
       you  sir  applause 
       if you can tell us what the floor is now  why can't you tell us the cap? 
        applause  because    
       applause 
       because we're talking about two different things  aren't we? 
       on the floor  i think it's important that we give people 
       the protection of their savings  which is greater than it is today  
       that's why we've set that figure at &#163;100 000  
       but on the cap  as to where you set that figure as to the absolute 
       figure that people pay  amount that people pay  
       i think it's right that we have that consultation  
       we will consult  as i've just said to barry  with individuals  
       but also with organisations that deal with these issues  
       charities that work with older people  to make sure we get 
        that at the right level   ok  
       victoria davey  let's go on to another question  
       sorry  yes  you  
       we had a cap of &#163;79 000  
       why can't we at least start with something around that figure? 
       in our manifesto we said we weren't following the dilnot    
       those are the andrew dilnot proposals  
       we weren't going to follow those andrew dilnot proposals 
       and there were two reasons why  
       the first is that those tended to protect people who were 
       wealthier but didn't protect people who were on modest incomes  
       and secondly it required payment out of taxation  
       and i actually think that if you're going to be fair across the 
       generations  then we don't ask young people to be having their 
       taxes increased in order to pay for the social care costs of 
       somebody who may    people who may be sitting 
       on a very significant value in their house  
       applause 
       victoria davey  
       working as a nurse for 26 years  do the tories expect our support 
       in the light of another 1% pay increase? 
       applause 
       what we're looking at  in terms of the national health service  
       and ensuring that we can provide 
       the national health service in the future  is  
       if we just look at how much money is now being spent on the nhs  
       in the five years to 2020 we will be spending half a trillion pounds 
       on the national health service  
       now  we're putting more money in at the moment and we will continue 
       to put more money in into the future into the nhs  
       bu it is important that we recognise  
       as you will know as a nurse  
       the demands on the nhs are increasing all the time  
       we recognise the work that the nhs staff do  but    
       but nurses get paid less and less  
        nurses get an increase  obviously some other payments as well   no  no  
       a real terms decrease of 14% since 2010  
       so don't tell us we're getting a pay rise  
       let the person sitting next to you say it  the nurse  
       i agree with that  
       my wage slips from 2009 reflect exactly what i'm earning today  
       so how can that be fair in light of the job that we actually do? 
       and i recognise the job that you do  
       then why hasn't it changed before now  then? 
       we have had to take some hard choices across the public sector 
       in relation to public sector pay restraint  
       we did that because of the decisions we had to take 
       to bring public spending under control 
       because it wasn't under control under the last labour government  
       and i'm being honest with you  
       in terms of saying that we will put more money into the nhs 
       but there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake 
       that suddenly provides for everything that people want  
       you come in on this  
       you say you'll cut  you're cutting nhs spending  
       but you also cut tax for the rich? 
       applause 
       we're not actually cutting nhs spending  we're putting in fact 
       record levels of funding overall into the national health service 
       and we will continue to increase the funding 
       for the national health service in government  
       but other countries spend way more on their health service than we do  
       but we're giving it out for free  
       so why are we spending less? 
       well  it's not    i mean  the figures do vary  
       but actually it's not the case 
       that all other countries are spending more money 
       on their nhs than we are  
       we are putting more funding into the nhs  
       we're putting and we will continue to do that  
       but i also want to do some other things in relation to the nhs  
       we have put into a requirement that mental health should be given 
       parity of esteem with physical health in the nhs  
       i think there's    
       more money's going into it  but there's more for us to do  
       in our manifesto  we've set out a whole package 
       of what we can do on mental health  
       it's not just about the money that's going into the nhs  
       which will increase  it's about ensuring that we're dealing 
       and addressing the issues we need to  
       and i think mental health is something 
       that's been put to one side for too long 
       and not been given the attention it deserves  
       going back to the nurses just for a moment  
       do you think it's fair that the nurses get just the 1% increase 
       year in  year out  regardless of inflation  
       so they get poorer  so some of them  we're told  go to food banks? 
       is that fair  do you feel  do you sleep happy at that? 
       the public sector has been restrained 
       in its pay to 1% increase  
       of course  there will be those working within the nhs  
       nurses and others  who will get progression pay increases  
       are they not a special case  compared    
       are they not a special case  nurses  
       compared with other people in the public sector? 
       well  people in the public sector across all sorts of services 
       are working very hard on some jobs that we want them to do because they 
       are about looking after us  about protecting us  about caring for us  
       but we have to look at public sector spending  
       we have to make sure that we're managing our money carefully 
       because  at the end of the day  as i say  
       there isn't a magic money tree that suddenly delivers all the money 
       everybody wants for the spending everybody wants  
       you may hear later on that you can ask for anything 
       that you want to have money spent on  
       but actually  you can't  it's not there  
       we have to ensure we manage your money  taxpayers' money  carefully  
       there are a lot of hands up  so i'll go to you  sir  first  
       and then    
       you mentioned mental health there  i'm just wondering  
       does that include the work capability assessment 
        with the mental health as well?   it's     
       because i've just recently failed that assessment   so have i   
       just through mental health  
       there's a number of things we want to do  
       hold on  you say your bit  too  
        you're sitting together by chance?   by chance   by chance  
       ok  well  say what you were going to say  then  go on  
       basically  again on mental health  i agree  it's so important  
       the nhs is an absolute shambles for mental health at the moment  
       i applied for nhs counselling about  i think  probably the end of 2015  
       my first appointment is next tuesday   yes   
       my first appointment is next tuesday  
       i've been waiting a year and a half for this 
       and i have suffered so much over that year  
       in part because of the work capability assessment  
       applause 
       and let me tell you    
       let me tell you  i'm partially sighted as well  
       i'm partially sighted  i have mental health problems 
       and also i have other issues  jaw issues  
       and i went into my assessment and i was asked in detail 
       about suicide attempts and i came out crying 
       because i was so upset because of the way i was treated by that nurse  
       and she came out after me   she'd forgotten to measure my eyesight  
       i'm partially sighted  
       she found time to  you know  insult me  basically  
        by asking for all these upsetting details   all right  
       let the prime minister answer  
       i'm not going to make any excuses for the experience that you've had  
       that's why i think it is so important 
       that we actually do deal with mental health  
       both of you have raised two different issues  
       one is how we deal with mental health issues in the health service  
       and the other is actually the work capability assessment  
       and this is something where we are    
       we do look at improving how that assessment has taken place  
       but i know your    i know the issue of mental health is a particularly 
       difficult one to address in term of those work capability assessments  
       on the national health service  
       and the other things we want to do with mental health  
       one of the things i want to do is ensure better support in schools 
       so that we have individual members of staff trained in schools 
       who are able to better identify mental health problems 
       and then know how to address them  
       and i was talking to a young woman only at the turn of the year 
       who  in school  said nobody had really known what to do 
       because of her mental health problems  
       so she'd suffered as a result  
       if we can give people the support they need at an earlier stage  
       it's better for everybody  
       but as i say  i make no excuses for the experience that you had  
       all right  the woman in orange  i'm sorry  we've got to go on 
       cos we've only got ten more minutes with the prime minister  yes  
       i think it's fair to say that mental health funding is one of your 
       soundbites whenever people ask you about the nhs  
       but it really concerned me a couple of weeks ago  
       you were filmed when a lady 
       challenged you about her benefits for learning difficulties  
       you turned around and gave an answer about mental health funding 
       and it really concerned me that 
       the prime minister and potential future prime minister of the uk 
       apparently doesn't understand the difference between 
       a learning disability and a mental health condition  
       applause drowns out speech 
       in fact  when the lady first spoke to me  she talked about learning 
       disabilities and mental health  
       she'd actually raised mental health herself  
       but i recognise that the particular issue she had 
       was about learning disabilities  
       but this is    both of these are areas where we need to ensure 
       that we've got the ability for people's needs to be identified 
       at as early a stage as possible 
       and then the support goes in  
       obviously  all the evidence is  
       the earlier you can get that support to somebody  
       the earlier you can identify an issue  
       then the better it is for that individual  
       but also the better it will be for the rest of their lives  
       that's why on the mental health front  as i say  
       i'm so keen to ensure that we get more support  in terms of training 
       in schools  there are other things i want to do as well  
       including in the work place  actually  because too often 
       i think there is discrimination in relation to mental health 
       in the work place so i want to    
       i'm going to bring in a new mental health act  
       scrap the old mental health act  
       but also change the equalities legislation so that discrimination 
       on mental health will not be possible in the workplace  
       robert waite  let's have your question  
       robert waite  please  
       i will be voting tory  but i'm not happy with the foreign aid budget  
       and especially why we are giving money to north korea? 
       can you explain that  please? 
        well  we     applause 
       i think the commitment we've given on the foreign aid budget 
       is an important one  
       and i think it's an important one for two reasons  
       first of all  we are one of the    
       we're the fastest growing  
       second fastest growing economy in the g7 last year  
       we are one of the most significant economies in the world  
       i think it's right that we say that we help those people 
       who are less well off than we are in those developing countries  
       there are millions of children  
       millions of girls  being educated today  
       who would not be educated were it not for the foreign aid money 
       that we're giving  
       but it's also about something else 
       because it means that in certain states 
       it's possible to help to develop the economy  
       the governance of that state  and that is of benefit to us 
       in protecting us as a united kingdom for a whole range of reasons  
       if we can stabilise some certain countries  then that's going to be 
       better for us both in terms of security  for example  
       robert  do you want to come back? 
       we do look very carefully at individual countries and payments  
       but north korea  
       some laughter 
       that is one of the worst places going  surely  
       it is not somewhere that    
       i would    
       suggest that is somewhere that one holds out as a paragon of virtue  
       i think what the dprk  what north korea has been doing 
       in terms of its missiles and its nuclear situation    
       and  you know  we had another ballistic missile test only 
       a few days ago  we're clear that we want to see those changes in 
       north korea  i think it's important for china to be influencing those  
       does the aid budget go to north korea? 
       does north korea receive money from the aid budget? 
       the gentleman has suggested that it did  
       i don't know the details of that  
       about &#163;4 million in 2015  
       &#163;4 million?  yeah   ok  you  sir  in the red and white checked shirt  
       so you're the prime minister of the country and you don't know 
       where that foreign aid is going to  
       whether it's going to the government 
       or it's actually going to benefit its people? 
       if we are putting money into    when we put money into countries  
       we change the way that we spend the foreign aid budget  
       in the past  foreign aid budget 
       was all too often just given to governments 
       and you know the stories in the past of the way the money was then spent  
       so we work through ngos  we work 
       through organisations that are helping people  so money 
       that we put into countries 
       is targeted on things like education  on health  
       on welfare of people  
       on support for the people who are the most vulnerable  
       ok  brief one from you  sir  
       you spoke earlier of foreign aid money  
       can you explain why it is that a great deal more of our largesse 
       that goes to the rest of world 
       is not in the form of british manufactures rather than of cash? 
       it's much easier to avoid having a field hospital pocketed 
       than it is a few million of cash 
       and it's also the case that if this money fed its way 
       through british manufacturing and provided british jobs  
       there would be much less contention 
       concerning the sums of money given away  
        can you answer briefly?  yes  
       applause 
       first of all  some of money we're talking about 
       is not about buying kit in the sense of 
       things that would be manufactured here  
       i've just said  if you're talking about education  
       it's about providing the facilities where children who would not 
       otherwise be educated are being educated  
       but we do give support to countries in ways other than just the money  
       so there are some countries where we are  indeed  our military are 
       working on things like field hospitals 
       and providing those directly  
       if we want to improve british manufacturing around the world  
       that's why i want to ensure we get good trade agreements around 
       the whole of the world when we leave the european union  
       applause ok  sally jones  please  
       sally jones  
       yes  fire away  
       state schools are underfunded and teachers are overworked  
       why are you putting money into grammar schools when state schools 
       are beneficial to all abilities? 
       ok  why   ? applause 
       stick with the grammar schools issue  
       sally  what we're doing  
       the grammar schools will be within the state sector  
       they might be free schools  they might be other types of schools  
       we want a diversity of education  because education is so important  
       i want every youngster to get the best possible start in life and that 
       means every youngster getting the education that is right for them  
       we are actually putting more money    
       you said we're putting money 
       into the possibility for grammar schools to be set up  
       yes  but we're also increasing the overall amount of money 
       that goes into schools and ensuring there's a fairer 
       distribution of that money across the country  
       but i believe it's important that 
       if we know that there are good schools out there    
       at the moment we have a law that says you can't set up any more 
       of these types of schools  despite the fact that they're good  
       i think that's wrong  i think we should allow new grammar schools 
       to be set up so we ensure every child gets the education 
       that's right for them and the best possible start in life  
       the woman there  applause 
       in the school that i work in  
       by 2020  every single child in that school 
       will receive &#163;898 per year less 
       than under a labour government in 2020  
       my question to you is why do you care less about the children 
        than a labour government?  i don't care less about the children  
       applause 
       &#163;898     i don't      ok     per child    
       you're saying the per child  per pupil spending has fallen  
         per annum  by 2020  
        not the overall figure but how much you get   &#163;898  
       ok  you made the point  let the prime minister answer  
       there are two things i want to do because i do care about education  
       as i have said in response to sally  i think it is so important 
       for every youngster to get the best start in life  
       that's why we will be putting more money overall into the schools  
       we'll be ensuring the pupil premium 
       is there for those children who are disadvantaged  
       but we will also ensure that there is a fairer distribution 
       of school funding because  at the moment  as you probably know  
       there are some schools that get twice the amount of money per pupil 
       than other schools in other parts of the country  
       i want to see a fairer system of funding and  in doing that  
       we will make sure that no school sees a budget cut 
       when that fairer funding is introduced  
       but getting a good quality education isn't just about the money going 
       into schools  it's about ensuring that we're encouraging people 
       to come into the teaching profession  
       so we're going to give student loan forgiveness to people who come into 
       teaching and stay in teaching  
       it's about a diversity of types of school  
       so we see innovation and creativity in education  
       so we genuinely can say in this country that how far you go in life 
       depends not on where you come from or who your parents are  
       but it depends on your talents and abilities 
       and your willingness to work hard  
       ok  applause 
       we've got a couple of minutes left  mandy holder  
       mandy holder  let's have your question  
       why haven't you signed a letter to donald trump  condemning his 
       decision to pull out of the paris climate change agreement? 
       something which    applause 
       something which the presidents of germany and france 
       and italy have done  
       yes  and i haven't because i actually have spoken to donald trump 
       and told him the uk believes in the paris agreement 
       and that we didn't want the united states to leave the paris agreement  
       the g7 leaders sat round the table last week 
       and spoke to  and told donald trump  
       the six of us told him that we believed the paris agreement was 
       an important international agreement on climate change  that we wanted 
       the united states to stay in it  
       i've spoken to him  i spoke to him last night about this  
        what did he say?  canada and japan haven't signed the letter either  
        what did he say?  what did he say? 
       he says he's taken the decision because he thinks it's in 
       the best interests of america  
       i say that the paris agreement 
       actually is important for us globally 
       in terms of dealing with climate change  
       that's why the uk supported it 
       and it's why the uk is continuing to support it  
       you're negotiating our departure from the eu  
       wouldn't it have been sensible and prudent 
       to go along with france and germany and italy  
       and sign a letter to donald trump  instead of it being released 
       that you just said you were disappointed by his decision? 
       it's not a question of 
       whether or not we should go along with somebody else  david  
       we take independent decisions as the uk  
       i spoke to donald trump  
       i've told him my views from the uk's position last week  
       i told him last night what our views are   
       we remain committed to the paris agreement  
       we continue to think it's important 
       for dealing with climate change internationally  
       well  that  i'm afraid  ends the first half of this programme  
       prime minister  thank you very much  
       thank you very much  david  thank you  thank you  everybody  
       applause 
       and now  would you please welcome 
       the leader of the labour party  jeremy corbyn? 
       applause and cheering 
       good evening  good evening  mr corbyn  
       our first question to you comes from ciaran hepworth  please  
       why should the british public 
       trust you and your peers to negotiate brexit? 
       why should the british public 
       trust you and your peers to negotiate brexit? 
       thank you for inviting me here tonight  
       i'm very sorry this is not a debate  this is a series of questions  
       i think it's a shame the prime minister 
       hasn't taken part in a debate  
       applause 
       we're very clear on brexit  
       a referendum took place  a decision was reached  
       we're leaving the european union  
       secondly  we will immediately legislate in office to guarantee 
       rights of eu nationals to remain in this country  
       secondly  we will negotiate with the european union to guarantee 
       trade access to the european markets and protection of the conditions 
       that we've achieved through eu membership 
       because it's crucial to protect our manufacturing industry  
       your point about our negotiating team   we have a great team  
       we have a great team of very experienced people  
       keir starmer is one of the leading lawyers of this country  
       i think i can trust keir starmer with negotiations 
       more than some other people who are undertaking those negotiations  
       applause 
       on question time last night  
       your international trade secretary  barry gardiner  
       said that britain would absolutely   "absolutely" was his word   
       be poorer after leaving the eu  do you agree with that? 
       i don't think we necessarily would be poorer  
       i hope that we will retain  as i said  the trade access and 
       i hope also that we will have a labour government that will be 
       investing in a growing economy in this country 
       and challenging the terrible levels of inequality that exist 
       in this country at the same time  
       you  sir  
       david cameron went to the eu and asked for a few concessions  
       he got nothing because they knew that he would stay  
       he would want to stay in the eu  
       if the eu understands your position  
       that no deal is a bad deal  
       then you've got no chance  
       applause 
       i've made it very clear we accept the results of the referendum  
       i think it's important to go from that point  
       i've made the point also about the need for trade access 
       to the european union and there is  of course  an interest in that 
       on both sides of the channel  
       most of our big manufacturing companies have supply chains here 
       and in europe and vice versa  there is a mutual interest in this  
       but we're not approaching these negotiations by 
       threatening europe with setting up some kind of low tax haven 
       for big corporations in this country  
       we're instead saying we want to continue that trading relationship 
       outside the european union  
       but i think a sensible relationship with them is very important  
       i will approach those negotiations to build up a trust 
       which gives us that sensible relationship in the future  
       what    applause 
       what exactly do you think the british people meant  
       who voted to leave  
       and what do you understand by "leave the eu"? 
       what does it actually mean to you to leave the eu? 
       what is it that matters in that? 
       leaving the european union means we withdraw from the treaty of rome  
       we withdraw from the 1972 decision that was made 
       by the british government at that time 
       to join with the european union  
       it means that there is no longer a legislative authority over uk law 
       within the eu or a parliamentary consent for it  
       it means we have to have an independent and separate 
       relationship with the european union 
       and i think we've got two years to negotiate it and i can't wait 
       to get started to make sure that we do retain manufacturing industry 
       and service industry jobs in britain that are so essential 
       to our economy and our economic growth  
        but threatening will not work   is your aim to remain    
       applause 
       is your aim to remain in the single market? 
       do you think that's possible? 
       our aim is to have tariff free trade access to europe  
       i think we should put it in those terms 
       rather than anything else at this stage  
       ok  you  sir  over there  the far side  
       no  the man over there  
       that's it  cos he's spoken already  
       thank you  
       will you rule out doing a deal with nicola sturgeon in the event of 
       a hung parliament  because you will be negotiating  
       as you would expect  with the eu at that time? 
       we are fighting this election to win 
       and we're mounting a fantastic campaign 
       in order to get that message across 
       of how different our society and our politics could be  
       we are contesting all the constituencies  
       we are not looking to do deals with anybody  
       we are not forming a coalition government  
       i want to form a labour government with a majority to carry out this 
       amazing programme which can give so much hope and opportunity 
       to so many people  
       applause 
        thank you   so  no deals  
       that was the answer i expected 
       but it is wasn't the answer to my question  
       i thought your question    
       i thought your question was about deals and i said no deals  
       ok  i'm going to go to somebody else  
       you  sir  there  in the blue shirt  
       given the absence of the european court of justice  
       how will you uphold government accountability post brexit? 
       on environmental issues  for example  
       air pollution  we're already breaching limits  
       the european court of justice holds us to account  
       what will happen when we leave the eu? 
       i want to ensure the environmental protocols are adopted into uk law  
       i think it's very important to do that  
       it's also absolutely crucial for the future of all of us 
       that we have agreements with all of europe  
       be they part of the eu or not  on air pollution  on air quality  
       on sea pollution and protection of our seas 
       and our natural environment  
       i'm very determined to achieve that  
       since you raise the subject  
       i utterly deplore donald trump's decision to withdraw from 
       the paris climate change  
       i would sign a letter with any other leader 
       that would deplore that straight away  
       applause 
       let's come home for a moment  
       steve rudd  let's have your question  please  
        steve rudd   hi  steve  
       good evening  i run a small  local business  
       i'm faced with the possibility of higher corporation tax rates  
       obviously we've alluded to the uncertainty that brexit will create 
       over the next couple of years  
       today you've talked about creating jobs  
       i just wonder how i can have confidence that those jobs  
       well  that i  as a small business  can create those jobs? 
        i don't know how big your small business is   it's a micro business  
        this big  that big?   i employ five people   
        it's a small business  but it could grow   good  let's hope it does grow  
       but it can't grow in in uncertain times  that's the problem  
        absolutely   just specify again  
       what are your problems with the proposals that labour is making? 
       well  obviously it's the rise in corporation tax  
       it's the uncertainty of brexit and the outcome from brexit  
       it's planning ahead  basically  my problem is  
        ok   and obviously we've got the personal taxation issues 
       that create other issues further down the line  
       i'm sure you recognise there are huge problems in the funding 
       of our public services   health  education   
       and these have to be addressed and dealt with  
       we have a fully costed and fully funded manifesto here  
       that will cost  yes  
       and we will raise corporation tax up to 26p by the end of the parliament  
       that will be actually 2% lower than it was in 2010 
       and will actually be less than the g7 average  
       what it will also do is not raise corporation tax 
       for small and medium businesses by that amount  
       some will have no rise whatsoever  
       we have had very interesting and very good discussions with 
       a lot of small businesses about their problems of accessing capital  
       their problems of growing 
       because banks don't like them and aren't interested in them  
       and the need to have an investment strategy for this country  
       so on top of that  we will also be forming 
       a national investment bank to improve infrastructure 
       all across the country and develop new  high technology industries 
       which  i think  are the future of this country  
       unharness    let the people with the skills actually develop the jobs 
       and develop the industries in this country  
       so  yes  we are asking the very biggest corporations 
       to pay a bit more  but i tell you what  i think it's worth it  
       it's worth it so that any young person can go to university 
       and not leave with debt  
       it's worth it to make sure school head teachers don't have to collect 
       at the school gate in order to pay the teachers' salaries  
       i think it's worth it for a better society 
       in which everyone can achieve something  
       ok  applause and cheering 
        jack rowse  please   just to come back to you  
       i'm also working    i'm linked to an accountancy firm  
       so we obviously deal with larger businesses as well 
       as potential clients and existing clients  
       my choice  basically  and the choice of my clients  
       is a conservative government and a labour government 
       and the difference  as you say  2%  looking at it european wide  but 
       it's a 9% difference between what the conservatives are proposing 
       for corporation tax for larger businesses 
       and what the labour government is proposing  
       it's a fair question but i would simply say this   
       all of your clients  i'm sure  require workers at various times  
       they require skilled workers at various times  
       if we  as a society  don't look at the problems throughout 
       our school and education system and invest in it properly  
       where are the skilled workers going to come from tomorrow? 
       where are going to be the consumers of tomorrow? 
       i think it's time that we looked at inequality in our society 
       and used our public investment in order to improve services 
       and give real chances to everybody  
       poverty is a waste  
       people who can't get the education they want 
       and the qualifications they want  we all lose  
       it's a question of whether 
       the community gets together to support everybody 
       or we just let the rich get richer and the rest suffer  
       what's the    applause 
       what's the overall increase in the tax take that labour  
       if it comes to power  would expect? 
       what kind of percentage on the current tax take? 
       48 billion more    
       what percent is it that of what comes in at the moment? 
       48 billion more  which is quite a small proportion of the total  
       the point i'm making is that what we've got here is funding of 
       it through corporation tax  funding of it through some new taxes  
       95%  95% of the people of this country will pay no more in tax  vat 
       or national insurance  the others will be asked to pay a bit more  
       i think it's the right thing to do because it does gives us 
       a growing economy  
       the figures for the country as a whole  for the economy as 
       a whole  is nearly a 10% increase in tax take by the government  
       it brings me to a question from jack rouse  if i may  
       jack rouse  please  
       where is jack rouse? 
       yes  speak away  
       hi  jack  
       is labour's manifesto a realistic wish list 
       or is it just a letter to santa claus? 
       applause 
       i urge you to read it  
       i think it is a serious and realistic document that 
       addresses the issues that many people in this country face  
       we've been brave enough to put it out there  with all the 
       policies that are in it  
       how we deal with the school funding crisis  
       how we make sure pre school  all children  two to four  get 30 hours 
       childcare per week or opportunities for pre school play and education  
       how we bring back the educational maintenance allowance 
       so that youngsters who be would be deterred from staying on at 
       school or going on to get a levels or other qualifications  
       and that those who can get into university won't end up with debts 
       of 50 60 000 at the end of it  
       this is nothing unusual in many other countries in the world  
       i think it's time for us to invest in our future  
       the other crisis i may mention  david  is the question of health  
       the question of mental health and the question of social care  
       if we don't address it  what happens? 
       what happens is  more people suffer  
       what happens is  more women  usually  
       give up work to care for those who cannot be cared for because 
       we're not putting enough money into it  
       those with a mental health crisis suffer alone and don't get 
       the help and support that they want  
       we have to respect the needs of people and  frankly  
       challenge all of us to say   if we want to live in 
       a society that genuinely cares for all  we've got to be prepared 
       to deal with issues of inequality and pay for it  
        i'm prepared to do that   ok  
       jack speaks off mic 
         it's a question of funding it  
       i'm thinking of last time labour were in government  they left 
       a note at the chancellor's office saying  "we've no money left " 
       applause 
       what i would say is  
       for the past seven years of austerity  
       that austerity has hit public sector workers with a 1% cap  
       it has hit all our schools and public services  
       it has caused a housing crisis  
       and  do you know what  
       the very richest in our society have got richer  
       there's been more and more tax giveaways at the top end and 
       more and more charges at the other end  
       it's time to rebalance it  
       our manifesto is a serious  well thought out document that i 
       believe is getting a lot of support and people are very excited 
       by the idea of how we can do things differently  
       applause the woman here  in the third row  
       you say this manifesto is serious and well thought out  
       and you speak about creating an equal society  
       free from racism and anti semitism  but how can i believe 
       a word of this when you  as party leader  have failed to expel one of 
       your own members  ken livingstone  for his anti semitic remarks? 
       applause 
       there is no place for anti semitism anywhere in our society  
       and certainly not in our party  
       members have been suspended  if they've committed any remarks   
       but he's not been held to account  
         that can be seen to be of an anti semitic nature  
       those that have done that are suspended  
       we have a process that is independent of me within the 
       party which investigations these and makes a decision on it  
       i deplore racism in any form whatsoever  
       the way in which the jewish people have suffered down the centuries  
       the holocaust and all that went with it  
       was the most appalling stain in the history of mankind  
       and i believe we have to fight racism in any form 
       with every fibre of our being  
       a society that cannot challenge racism is 
       a society that is heading for division  
       i will not tolerate it in our party or anywhere else  
       applause do you want to come back on that? 
       if it's something that's so important to you  
       how can you suffice with only suspending him 
       for a short period of time? how is it not enough to expel him? 
       he has been suspended and further investigations may or may not 
       happen after the election  but he is suspended from membership  
       but he is suspended so that the investigation can take place  
       all right  the woman there  on the gangway  you  
        yes  you   me? oh  
       i heard you recently commented that black and ethnic minorities' 
       potential has been locked under the conservatives 
       and you plan to free up and unlock it  
       so i just want some clarification as to how exactly you plan to do it? 
       sorry  i didn't fully hear the question  
       there was a camera right in front of you at the time  
       sorry about that  
       i said there was a comment that i read in the news about you 
       purporting that black and ethnic minorities' potential has been 
       locked under the conservatives  
       so i just want some clarification as to how you'd 
       free it up or unlock it or help in that regard? 
       the issues are of poverty in britain  
       the issues are of differential levels of spending in inner city 
       areas compared to other areas and there are serious issues about 
       the number of young  black people  particularly young men  
       who are part of the criminal justice system  end up in youth custody 
       or youth justice institutions  
       or those that end up in mental health institutions  
       i think we have to look very seriously at levels of racism 
       within our society  
       if you like  racism that is almost of an institutionalised nature  
       that has to be looked at  
       and one of the issues we've put forward was  
       consider how difficult it can be for somebody with an african name 
       or a muslim name to get on a shortlist to get 
       an interview for a job  compared to others  
       so one suggestion   it is a suggestion  it may become a policy   
       is that we should have blind applications for jobs  
       where there's no name involved  there's merely a description 
       of your skills and abilities and qualifications  
       so there can be a fair assessment of that person  
       because we are a multiethnic  
       multilingual  multicultural society  
       if it doesn't treat everybody equally and give everybody a decent 
       chance  then we end up with poverty and discrimination and divisions  
       i want to see a country that comes together and is not divided 
       by poverty or by discrimination  
       applause 
       we may come back to education and the economy in a moment  
       but let's have this question from adam murgatroyd  please  
       adam murgatroyd? 
       if britain were under imminent threat from nuclear weapons  
       how would you react? 
       i would do everything i can to ensure that any threat is 
       actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks  
       so that we do adhere to our obligations 
       under the nuclear non proliferation treaty  
       that we do encourage china in its work in trying to bring about 
       six party talks  in resolving the issue in north korea  
       and we do follow the lead that president obama took 
       in doing a deal with iran that would result 
       in them not developing the nuclear capability  
       i think the idea of anyone  ever  using a nuclear weapon  
       anywhere in the world  is utterly appalling and terrible  
       it would result in the destruction of the lives and communities 
       and environment for millions of people  
       so i would be actively engaged to ensure 
       that danger didn't come about  
       i also be very aware of other dangers that we face  
       cyber attacks hit our national health service 
       a couple of weeks ago  
       the dreadful terrorist attack in manchester indicates the danger 
       of individual acts of terrorism that can take lives  
       we have to be secure here  
       we have to protect our society and our country  
       but we also have to engage in the rest of the world to make sure 
       we don't have huge  ungoverned spaces  such as in libya  
       which can become the basis of terrible events 
       that are going to take the lives of many other people  
       we have to deal with those issues here and globally  
       that is the function of a responsible government  
       applause 
       your party is committed to renewing trident  
       are you saying there are no circumstances in which 
       you would use a nuclear weapon at all? 
       i'm saying that our party has committed to renewing trident  
       that was a decision taken by the party conference  
       and indeed taken by parliament  
       i would view the idea of having to use a nuclear weapon 
       as something that was resulting in a failure 
       in the whole world's diplomatic system  
       there has to be no first use  
       there has to be a process of engagement 
       to bring about  ultimately  global nuclear disarmament  
       it's not going to happen quickly  it's not going to happen easily  
       but we have to have that wish  
       you cannot countenance a world in which 
       we could all be destroyed by nuclear war  
       you say no first use  and you wouldn't use    
       you wouldn't push the button in a first use  
       in retaliatory use  would you use nuclear weapons? 
       well  the weapon is there 
       and i would say no first use of the weapon  
       and i think that has to be the basis on what we do  
       adam  does that answer your question? 
       do you want to come back on it? 
       i find it incredibly concerning you wouldn't ever commit to doing that  
       it's our safety that we need to look at 
       first and foremost in a government  
       but what particularly annoys me is that trident isn't just for  
       heaven forbid  a potential corbyn government  
       it goes long beyond that  you know  
       many  many decades into the future  
       so when you are making the decision whether to support this or not  
       it's not just for right here and now  
       it's threats that we could face in the future  
       fair point  
       but we have to do everything we can  
       obviously to protect ourselves  
       but the best protection is having good and reasonable relationships 
       with the rest of world so we don't descend into a mentality 
       where there are military blocs starting threatening each other  
       and i'm utterly determined to do everything i can 
       to bring about a more peaceful world  
       i've spent a lot of my life with un and other organisations 
       trying to bring about principle of no first use  
       principles of disarmament 
       and principles of bringing about peace around the world  
       that  surely  is something we can all work for  
       i think we have to recognise 
       that there is deep inequality and injustice in the world  
       but the threats are  as i said  cyber security and terrorism  
       the other threats are  actually  of environmental disaster 
       around the world and large numbers of people fleeing 
       from environmental disaster  in effect environmental refugees  
       which is why i was so disappointed in president trump's decision  
       particularly in view of what had been achieved 
       by people working together to try to protect and sustain this planet  
       we've only got one planet  
       let's get together when we live on it 
       and  above all  let's not destroy it  
       can we just come   ? 
       applause 
       can we just come back to the nuclear issue? 
       you are prime minister  
       you've said you would have no first use  
       you wouldn't countenance britain's nuclear deterrent  
       which your party is restoring  rebuilding  maintaining  
       you wouldn't have a first use  
       and it raises the question  he said under direct attack  
       would you use it in retaliation? 
       as prime minister  you're speaking to the country 
       about what you would do with the most expensive defence weapon 
       that we have  
       are you saying you would never use it? 
       people tell me the most effective use of it is not to use it 
       because it's there  
       sorry  you're dodging the question  aren't you? 
       i'm saying    are you saying there are no circumstances 
       under which you'd use it? 
       any circumstances where anyone's prepared to use a nuclear weapon 
       is disastrous for the whole planet  
       that is why there has to be a policy of disarmament globally 
       but through a multinatural    multilateral policy  
       not a unilateral policy  
       but that's the ideal  but what about the reality  
       where you're faced with a prospect in which you may have to use it? 
       i'm asking for a simple answer  
       the reality is that we have to obviously try to protect ourselves  
       we would not use it as first use  
       and if we did use it  millions are going to die  
       you have to think this thing through  
       indistinct chatter from audience 
       i would decide on the circumstances at the time  
       all right  you  sir  
       would you use it as second use 
       or would you allow north korea or some idiot in iran to bomb us 
       and then say  "we had better start talking"? 
       you'd be too late  
        no  of course not   you're going to have to do it first  mate  
       no  of course not  of course i would not do that  
       you would allow them to do it? 
       of course not  because    
       how would you stop them? 
       that is why i made the point a short time ago 
       about the need for president obama's agreement with iran to be upheld  
       it's quite important  actually  
       and also to promote disarmament in korea  
        that is difficult  i appreciate    impossible   
       well    
        impossible   you up there  
       yeah  you're asking a massive wish 
       when you've got one of biggest arsenals by your side  
       i would rather have it and not use it than not have it at all  
       especially in today's day and age  
       applause 
       do you want to comment on that? 
       all right  anybody? the woman there  
       yes  let's just stick with this and then we'll move on  yes  
       i actually have a question regarding human rights  
       all right  use your question  
       just before    i don't understand why everyone in this room 
       seems so keen on killing millions of people with a nuclear bomb  
       cheering 
       i think it's worth moving on from that particular debate  
        because we are talking about murdering people   go on  move on  
       i want to ask a specific question about your immigration policy  
       you've mentioned that you want to reunite families  
       specifically  that have been forced apart 
       by theresa may's current migration policies  
       myself  my husband is recording this in america  
       as he's at work  he was deported in december  
       he was told he was too highly educated  
       despite studying here  getting an undergraduate and a master's degree  
       invested a lot in this country  
       i want to know whether you would consider 
       reducing the financial threshold for family migration 
       to be further in line with the national minimum wage 
       or living wage  
       yes  our manifesto has addressed this issue  
       it is very painful  some of the decisions that are made  
       where the frankly arbitrary level of income is chosen  
       couples are split apart  families are split apart  
       and people like the person you're talking about 
       have invested a huge amount of time and energy into this country 
       and are then removed from this country  
       who loses? we all lose  
       the family loses  the children lose  we lose as a society  
       we will change those immigration laws 
       so that there can be proper family reunion  
       i think that has been to be right and sensible thing to do  
       are you in favour of reducing immigration over all 
       into this country? 
       what i think will happen is this  
       that we have managed migration from outside europe  
       which is based on family reunion and skill needs or investment  
       we have  at the moment  free movement 
       from within the european union  
       that ends when we leave the european union  
       we'll then have to have managed migration from europe  
       we have to also recognise that those who have migrated to this country 
       have made a massive contribution to our society  
       the health of all of us depends on the work that's done 
       by many people who have made their homes here  
       what i think will happen 
       is there will probably be some reduction in european migration  
       because we will also prevent there being recruitment 
       of groups of low paid workers from central europe 
       to come here  to undermine existing conditions 
       that are often not very good themselves  
       and damage the life chances of people in the country 
       and be not actually very good for those who have been brought in  
       so we will end overseas only recruitment 
       and end those contractual arrangements 
       by which people are brought in  
       particularly into the construction industry  
       also  if i may say so  we have another issue 
       which we do have to address  and that is the skill shortage 
       and skill problem in britain because we have not invested enough 
       in industrial training  we've not invested enough in skill training  
       we've not invested enough in training more doctors 
       or more nurses in this country  
       until we do that  then we've got a big problem  
       and so our whole approach to our manifesto 
       is about investment for the future  
       yeah  
       i'm thinking of what your brexit secretary 
       or shadow brexit secretary  i should say  keir starmer  said  
       which is  "there has been a huge amount of immigration 
       "over the last ten years  and people are understandably concerned 
       "about it  i think it should be reduced " 
       when people voted brexit  
       do you think immigration was at the forefront of their minds? 
       i think it was a big factor in it  
       i don't think it was the only factor  but it was a big factor  
       there is also an issue that communities and local government 
       are often not sufficiently funded 
       to deal with groups of people coming in  
       and so we would restore what gordon brown had in 2009  
       which was a migrant impact fund  
       one or two more people    
       i'll come to you and then we'll go on to another question  
       can we get a microphone to you? yes  go on  fire away  
       mr corbyn  we talked about nuclear weapons before  
       but one thing that worries me more at the moment 
       as somebody who's grown up in a family business 
       is the changes in the minimum wage  
       i read your manifesto yesterday  
       and you are planning on increasing the minimum wage to &#163;10  
       the current plan for the national living wage  
       forecasts say that up to 60 000 people could lose their jobs 
       because of those increases in wages  
       so  firstly  how many jobs   what statistic have you been given 
       by your economist or whoever works for you 
       as to how many jobs will be lost if it goes up to &#163;10 an hour  
       and  secondly  how will you help the three million micro businesses 
       in the united kingdom who employ many people on the minimum wage 
       and already struggle to do that? 
       fair point and fair question  
       when the minimum wage was first introduced by the labour government 
       after the 1997 election  there were a lot of similar concerns 
       and predictions which turned out not to be the case  
       in fact  there was not any substantial number of job losses    
       yes  but  mr corbyn  the reason that happened 
       is because the wage increases were so small  
       if you look at the economic comments around that time  
       the wage increases were so small  all the commentators said that  
       this is a massive wage change  
       there is such a bigger margin of error now in your policies 
       than what was brought in in 1999  
       can i come back to your point? 
       what we're proposing is &#163;10 an hour by 2020  
       that would be a living wage  
       that would reduce the department of work and pensions bill somewhat  
       because you would be reducing in work benefit payments 
       because people would be being paid more  
       there are many big companies that could well afford to pay it 
       and shouldn't just be paying the minimum  
       there are companies  like i suspect yours  
       small companies that would have problems  we fully recognise that  
       we would therefore work with them  
       either to give them tax relief or support 
       in order to make sure that the living wage  
       the real living wage  was paid  
       but they didn't close down as a result of it  
       because as a society we have six million people 
       earning less than the living wage  
       we have a million people on zero hours contracts  
       we have wage levels  as a proportion of national income  
       actually falling at the present time  
       i think more money in the pockets will mean people are better off  
       but it will also be an economic boost itself  
       i absolutely recognise the problems for small and micro businesses  
       that's why there would be a pathway to it for them 
       with support from the government to achieve it  
       ok  edward  i will come to those    
       i just want to hear from edward robbins  
       cos mr corbyn just mentioned the issue  edward robbins  
       where is edward robbins? put your hand up  
       where are you? there! yes  good  
       zero hours contracts provide an easy way for students like myself 
       to get casual  flexible work  
       how will scrapping these contracts affect us? 
       labour policy to scrap zero hours contracts? 
       first of all  zero hours contracts for many people 
       mean a lifetime of stress and a lifetime of great difficulty  
       imagine what it's like if your sole source of income 
       is a zero hours contract job  
       you wake up in the morning  you look at your mobile phone 
       to see if your employer wants you that day or not  
       that week or not  you don't know what your income is going to be  
       now  i do understand the point about students and others  
       some companies  some employers say  
       "ok  we need people in a bar  
       "in a shop  in a packaging place  those kind of enterprises   
       "we will pay you x number of hours per week on a flexible basis 
       "so that you will have an average pay of  say  ten hours per week " 
       that means those people are loyal to the company  
       those people know what their income is going to be  
       that seems to me a much fairer way of doing it  
       so you then have some security of what's going on  
       there are some employers that do that 
       in towns with a large student population  with students  
       and it works quite well  
       what's your reaction? 
       well  i    i    
       i'm not going stop you working  it's ok  
       yeah  i was talking more about coming from us having the option 
       for students and us to go to employers 
       and say we want to work this time and this time  
       and not just getting told you are working this many hours this week  
        working when you choose  really?  yes  
       yeah  the so called gig economy  
       riding for delivery services? 
       yes  i think the agreement should be 
       that you come to a discussion with the employer  
       i can work for three hours on a monday  
       six hours on a thursday  two hours at a weekend  something like that  
       that's my work pattern  
       it's not simple to manage for any employer  
       i fully understand that  
       but it does give the security to the individual  
       it also gives the employer a wide range of workers 
       who will be working and will be loyal to that employer  
       you  sir  at the back there  
       mr corbyn  why have you never regarded the ira as terrorists? 
       i have deplored all acts of terrorism 
       by anybody in northern ireland or anywhere else  
       i think the good friday agreement was a huge achievement 
       that was brought about when both communities recognised 
       their shared but different pasts 
       and brought about the idea of a power sharing government 
       in northern ireland  i think that was an enormous achievement  
       it's been copied elsewhere in the world as a way forward  
       i don't approve of any terrorism of any sort 
       or any terrorist acts of any sort  
       it only divides communities and kills people  
       they killed a lot of people  
       does that answer the question for you? 
       they did kill a lot of people  didn't they? 
       all deaths are wrong  all killing is wrong  
       we have to develop  and we did in northern ireland  eventually  
       a very effective peace process  
       i think we should pay tribute to those in the unionist community 
       as well as those in the nationalist community 
       for coming together to bring about that peace process  
       it was a truly remarkable experience  
       ok  you  sir  
        yes  you didn't want to speak?  me? 
       i thought you had your hand up  
       you've got the microphone over your head  you're all right  
       you said you didn't support the ira  
       you've also supported hamas and other terrorist organisations  
       how do you expect the british people to vote for you 
       to go into number ten when you sat there and supported them? 
       we've seen you  
       i have not supported any of those organisations  
       what i've said is  and i'm sure you'd probably agree with it  
       that if you're to bring about a peace process anywhere  
       be it the middle east  be it in ireland  
       be it in a different situation  in say columbia  or anywhere else  
       there has to be a coming together  
       you were talking to them when they were killing our people  
       our women and children  you were talking to them  
       there has to be    well    
       i was talking to representatives of the republican movement  yes  
       actually  so was the government at the same time  
       ian paisley was indeed thrown out of parliament 
       when he told the government  told margaret thatcher 
       she was actually talking to them  do you know what? 
       i voted that ian paisley shouldn't be thrown out of parliament  
       because i thought his voice should be heard in parliament  
       you have to bring about a peace process 
       by talking to people that you don't agree with  
       if you just talk amongst your friends  
       you're not going to get a peace process  
       is that it? are you done? you keep poking the man in front of you  
       do you want him to speak? me  again  
        you keep poking him   do you want to speak? 
       are you trying to speak?  i wasn't  but i can do   ok  
       you've talked to these people in the past  
       you talked earlier on when talking about the nuclear option  
       talking is the way you want to go  
       david often said at the end of programmes  
       tell the public to press the red button  
       are you saying you will never  ever  under any circumstances  
       press the red button? 
       i think we've discussed this at some length 
       about the aspirations we all have  
       i do not want to be responsible 
       for the destruction of millions of people  neither do you  
       therefore we have to work for a world 
       where they're not available and not used  
       the man with the beard over there  yes  
       just to bring it back to economics  
       it's all very well for a socialist to stand there 
       with his very nice little red book and say  
       "we're going to fund all these lovely programmes 
       "by taking more money from big business " 
       but what's your plan for the economy when those businesses 
       turn round and say  "ok  you can keep your high taxes  
       "we'll go elsewhere"? 
       you look at the businesses we are talking about  
       they are actually doing very well  
       they have done extremely well over the past six years 
       because their tax has been cut a great deal  
       i think we have to look at the problems of our public services  
       we have to look at the issues 
       of what kind of economic future we have  
       we cannot go on being a low waged economy  
       under spending on our public services  
       investing less than any other industrialised country 
       in our future  
       i would much prefer that we develop a national investment bank 
       and strategy  regionally based  to improve rail  
       broadband  road communications  
       that we improve investment in our industry for the future  
       we have a lower proportion of manufacturing industry than germany  
       we have a lower level of productivity than germany  
       we have a lower skill base than germany  
       why is there a difference? 
       because successive german governments  
       almost irrespective of which party it is  
       have been prepared to invest in their infrastructure 
       and their future  
       i think we should think about that and improve the economy 
       of our own society  
       do you know what? that would lead to better economic growth  
       it would lead to better opportunities for everybody  
       i think this is an offer that's important  
       and i think it's time that we actually invested in our future 
       rather than presided over our decline  
       he's saying    
       if i understood him  he's saying businesses may scarper 
       under the weight of extra taxation  what do you do then? 
       there's already that issue of uncertainty with brexit anyway  
       we've seen certain companies umming and aahing and saying 
       "will we stay or will we go?" 
       if you say to them they're going to have to pay more tax 
       when you stay here as well  what's their incentive to stay? 
       actually  the corporation tax level that i'm proposing 
       would actually be less than there is anywhere 
       in the major industrial countries of western europe anyway  
       the crucial thing  and you are right to raise it  
       has to be gaining tariff free trade access to the european market 
       as the basis on which they can continue  
       look at it this way   if airbus are in this country  as they are  
       they manufacture aircraft parts  they manufacture satellite parts  
       and the final assembly for the aircraft takes place in toulouse  
       some of the parts are made here  
       some of the engines are made in other places  
       some parts are made in spain  
       that final assembly takes place  
       if we don't have that tariff free access to the european market  
       are they going to stay? would they want to stay? 
       ask yourself that question  
       you could say the same for many other big manufacturing enterprises  
       that is why the crucial thing has to be 
       maintaining that economic relationship with europe 
       outside membership of the european union  
       that is the best way of guaranteeing jobs 
       and a growing manufacturing economy in britain  
       but you will also have a government that is investing 
       alongside them to improve skill levels and improve communication 
       within this country  
       a very brief point from you  sir  then i'll take one last question  
        quickly  if you would   about security earlier  
       and a few months ago you were quoted on    
       well  you said on television that one of the things you would do 
       if you were successful in coming into government 
       was perform a strategic defence review  
        now     you have to be quick  
         they've just gone through a strategic defence review  
       why do we need another one? 
       every government that comes into office 
       does a strategic defence review  
       there are serious issues about the shortage of ships in the navy  
       there are serious issues about supplies of frigates  
       there are serious issues about maritime surveillance aircraft 
       that are not available that have to be addressed  
       there's a crucial issue of cyber security and cyber attacks 
       that have taken place on us  
       there's a crucial issue about terrorist attacks  
       i don't believe you make a society safer 
       by getting rid of 20 000 police officers  
       as this government has done since 2010  
       hannah  hannah lindsey  please  
       hannah lindsey  very quickly  though  hannah  if you would  
       is it right to scrap university tuition fees 
       as such an immediate priority when there is so much else 
       that needs doing in terms of living quality 
       for so many people in britain? 
       just to say  it's 11 billion  a quarter of your entire spending  
       why university fees? 
       i think we should invest in education for the future  
       and i do think that abolishing university tuition fees 
       means that any young person has then got the chance to go to university 
       if they can get in  
       if you look at the process of applications at the moment  
       the number of working class students is dropping  
       the number coming from poorer communities is dropping  
       i want to see real access for everybody  
       i think that's the right thing to do  
       it would not be unusual in many other parts of the world to do this  
       listen  as a young person  basically i had the offer of free education  
       i didn't take it up  that was my choice 
       and i'm not complaining about it  
       i don't think it's up to me and my generation 
       to pull up the ladder on the generations that are coming behind  
       i want to see an education system that really does work for all 
       so that every child can develop to their full potential  
       irrespective of their background and their life chances  
       mr corbyn  i'm sorry  we have to stop you there  
       thank you very much indeed  
        i've got so much more to say!  your time is up  
       cheering 
       so  that brings us to the end of this edition of question time  
       thank you all for coming here to york 
       to put questions to the two party leaders
